<h1>The Best Sagas According to Jerry</h1>

<h2>My top 3 sagas of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Star Wars</h2>
<p>One of my favorites even though it starts slow, it builds the enchanchtment of each character and builds to a wonderful ending.
</p>

<h2>Lord of the Rings</h2>
<p>The story line and direction of this sage is just impecciable and draws the attention of most anyone to the movies.

</p>

<h2>Jason Bourne</h2>
<p>This saga, though I do not prefer government movies, is well written and directed to claim the attention of many people wheter interesed in these types of movies or not.
