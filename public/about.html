<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am new but not new to the world of computers. I have a strong interest in learning all I can about the many aspects of the computer world. I began my journey into IT in 2020, and found that I have a deep desire to program and build. This desire took me on a path to learning and diving deeper into the world of coding. I enjoy seeing something so complicated on the eyes becoming something beautiful for all to see and enjoy.
